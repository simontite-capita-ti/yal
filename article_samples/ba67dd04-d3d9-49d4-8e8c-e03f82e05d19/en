The Juan Fern치ndez fur seal ("Arctocephalus philippii") breeds on the Juan Fern치ndez Islands off the coast of Chile. It is the second-smallest of the otariid seal (the closely related Gal치pagos fur seal is smaller still). Discovered by navigator Juan Fern치ndez in the 16th century, the seals became a target for sealers in the Maritime Fur Trade era. They were thought extinct in the mid-20th century until a population of 200 was found. The population was protected and has grown quickly. There are now believed to be at least 10,000 animals on and around the island.
