==Geography==
Filiates is located in a largely mountainous area. The Mourgana mountains lie to the north, on the border with Albania. Filiates is located southwest of Konitsa, west of Ioannina, northeast of Igoumenitsa and southeast of Sarandë, Albania. The Greek National Road 6 (Larissa - Ioannina - Igoumenitsa) and the Egnatia Odos motorway (Alexandroupoli - Thessaloniki - Ioannina - Igoumenitsa) pass south of the municipal unit.
The municipal unit Filiates has a land area of 495.727 km² and a population of 8,288 (2001 census). The population of the town Filiates, one of the biggest towns in the area, was 2,246 and the community population was 2,344.

Because of its high altitude (~850m) location on a west-facing slope, Filiates has one of the wettest climates in Greece.
== History ==
=== Ancient history ===
In antiquity, the area of Filiates was inhabited by the Epirot Greek tribe of the Chaonians.
In antiquity the city was known as Cestrine (or "Kestrine"), separated from Thesprotia by the River Thyamis. In the past, the city was also known as Cammania, Cestria, Filiates, Ilion, Epirus, Troy, Epirus and Troia, Epirus. According to Pausanias ("Description of Greece"), Cestrine took its name from Cestrinus, the son of Helenus, having previously borne the appellation of Cammania.
=== Modern history ===
In 15th century Filiates came under Ottoman rule and became part of Sanjak of Ioannina. During 17th and 18th century Ottoman rule a significant part of the town's population converted to Islam. According to Eton (1799, p.389) the people of Paramythia "spoke Greek, and knew no other language", and do not remember how they converted to Islam.
In 1911 during the period of the dissolution of the Ottoman empire, Albanians of Filiates formed "çetes", armed guerilla groups fighting for autonomy from the Ottoman empire. On the other hand, the local Greek population displayed tolerance towards actions by the Albanians that didn't reveal chauvinist inclinations.
During the Greek-Italian War the town was burned by collaborationist Cham Albanian bands (October 28-November 14, 1940). It was home to a Cham Albanian community, before 1944, when they fled because a large part of them collaborated with Nazi forces. In June 1945 a great part of Filiates was burned by Greek bands during the expulsion of Cham Albanians. Almost all Cham Albanian monuments of Filiates were destroyed during WWII.
