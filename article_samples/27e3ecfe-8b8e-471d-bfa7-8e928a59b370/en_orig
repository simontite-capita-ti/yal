"Someone Put Your Hand Out" (on disc three of "The Ultimate Collection") is a song originally written by Michael Jackson with Teddy Riley in 1987 for the "Bad" album and re-written in April 1992, having failed to make it on to Jackson's 1991 album "Dangerous". It was released May 1992 in Europe as an exclusive Pepsi promotional single, to promote Jackson’s upcoming Dangerous World Tour. 500,000 (source needed)(copies were made available by collecting a winning token from certain Pepsi products. It was also released as part of an exclusive Pepsi promotional pack in June 1992 throughout Europe and the United Kingdom. The promotional pack included a Michael Jackson poster, a promotional sticker, a press release about Jackson’s upcoming Dangerous World Tour and a cassette single of "Someone Put Your Hand Out". In 1993 the song was also planned to be released in the United States as a promotional CD for the Sony Walkman. Customers who purchased a special Michael Jackson signature Sony Walkman would receive a bonus CD featuring "Someone Put Your Hand Out" as well as other rare Jackson songs and remixes of his hits. However, this promotion was withdrawn following the 1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson.
