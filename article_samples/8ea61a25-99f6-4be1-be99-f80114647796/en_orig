==History==
"Less Than Perfect" debuted in a Tuesday evening time-slot and received steady ratings for its first two seasons. When the series was moved in its third season to a Friday-night time-slot, ratings began to fall sharply, and the show was considered to be in danger of cancellation.
TVGuide.com featured the show on a list of "Endangered Series." Ratings in the coveted 18–49 demographic were high enough, and the show was near the threshold for number of episodes needed for syndication, so a limited fourth season of 13 episodes was ordered.
After a long hiatus from ABC's schedule, the show returned as a late-season replacement for ABC with its fourth season premiere on Tuesday, April 18, 2006 at 9:30 p.m.
Despite the pickup, the future of the series was not assured. Cast member Zachary Levi stated many cast members were ready to move on, and series lead Sara Rue had filmed a pilot for CBS starring as a woman who runs a toy company with her brother in the comedy "Play Nice".
ABC confirmed on May 17, 2006 that the fourth season would be its last. ABC showed only part of the fourth season as scheduled. After five of the 13 episodes aired, ABC ceased broadcasting the show, with the last episode broadcast on June 6, 2006. However, those episodes which were not broadcast in the US have been shown in other countries.
The show joined Lifetime Television's lineup on June 1, 2009 in syndication. The network aired all 81 episodes, including the eight Season 4 episodes previously not broadcast in the US. But as of 2010, it was no longer on Lifetime's schedule.
As of April 2012, Less Than Perfect is part of the lineup of new network ABC Spark.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Early reviews for the show found the characterization generally stereotypical, but critics often praised the performance of Sara Rue. "USA Today" asserted that "in just two episodes, the good guys/bad guys structure and the exaggerated characterizations already are showing signs of wear," although it called Rue a "welcome addition" to TV sitcoms. "People" magazine likewise criticized the stereotypical characters, but summarized the show as "Hardly perfect but happily Rueful." However, by Season 3, "USA Today" said the show had "hit its stride."
