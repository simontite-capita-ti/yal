:"This article is about the animated series. For the video game series, see "Earthworm Jim".
Earthworm Jim is an US-American animated television series based on the video game with the same name which appeared on Kids' WB! for two seasons from September 9, 1995 through December 13, 1996. The series follows the adventures of an earthworm named Jim, who is turned into a superhero by a robotic super suit.
==Premise==
"Earthworm Jim" retains the absurdist and surreal humor of the games as well as introducing its own features. Most episodes involve the series' numerous villains attempting to reclaim the super suit, rule/destroy/freeze/knock over the universe, or otherwise causing mayhem throughout the galaxy. Other problems facing Jim include returning his neighbor's eggbeater and finding a new power source after his suit is depowered. Also, the show breaks the fourth wall with characters often talking to the audience and the narrator.
Episodes begin with Earthworm Jim and Peter Puppy in some peril that has nothing to do with the main plot or the previous episodes, with little explanation of how they got into the mess. In between parts (generally before or after the commercial break), there is a short side-story, generally featuring one of the villains doing a more natural part of life, usually without any involvement from Jim. These can range anywhere from Psy-Crow going through a career change, Evil the Cat disguising himself as a movie star in order to make his evil plans known to the world, or Professor Monkey-For-A-Head attending group therapy and always ending with "and now, back to Earthworm Jim." The end of every episode involves Jim or any other character being crushed by a cow, a play on the first game of the series (in the first stage, the player launches a cow into the sky, only to have it crush the princess upon the game's ending).
==Production==
The series was produced by Universal Animation Studios along with AKOM, Flextech Television Limited, and Shiny Entertainment.
2 seasons were produced, a total of 23 episodes.
==Broadcast history==
In the United States, the show was aired on Kids' WB! on The WB Television Network.
In the UK, it was shown on Channel 4 and TCC (The Children's Channel) in the 90s, and as of 2000's, the show has seen occasional reruns on Nickelodeon.
The cartoon was broadcast in the Republic of Ireland on RTE Two in 1997.
==Characters==
Most of the main characters from the show originated from characters introduced in the "Earthworm Jim" (1994) and "Earthworm Jim 2" (1995) video games. Peter Puppy becomes Jim's sidekick and friend and Princess What's-Her-Name his love interest. Many villains from the game, including Evil the Cat, Psy-Crow, Bob the Killer Goldfish, Queen Slug-for-a-Butt and Professor Monkey-for-a-head also appear in the show.
Additionally, some original characters were also created for the show, and were then in turn integrated into video games released after the TV series. For example, Evil Jim, an evil duplicate of Earthworm Jim created for the show, went on to be the main antagonist for the game "".

==Legacy==
Aspects of the show, such as newly created characters, or art style, were later implemented in future video games "Earthworm Jim 3D" and "". Two Earthworm Jim comic book series, in the US and UK, were also created to tie in to the animated series.
A line of action figures based on the show was released by Playmates. The series included several variants of "Earthworm Jim", as well as "Peter Puppy", "Princess Whats-Her-Name", "Bob the Killer Goldfish", "#4", "Evil the Cat", "Hench Rat", "Major Mucus" and "Psycrow". A mountable "pocket rocket" was also available as well as a rare mail-in repainted figure of Earthworm Jim in a green suit. A second series of figures was planned, but ultimately canceled - it would have included "Queen Slug-for-a-Butt", "Professor Monkey-for-a-Head" and "The Hamstinator" among others.
In April 2008, a new "Earthworm Jim" television series was announced, however, so far, nothing has resulted from this announcement.
