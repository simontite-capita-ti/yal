The Chalcedonian Definition (also Confession or Creed of Chalcedon) was adopted in 451 at the Council of Chalcedon in Asia Minor. That council was the fourth of the first seven Ecumenical Councils, which are accepted by Chalcedonian churches (Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, and many Protestant churches). It is the first Council "not" recognized by any of the Oriental Orthodox churches, which may be classified as non-Chalcedonian.
