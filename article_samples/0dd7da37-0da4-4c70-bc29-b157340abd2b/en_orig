The is the executive branch of the government of Japan. It consists of the Prime Minister, who is appointed by the Emperor after being designated by the National Diet, and up to fourteen other members, called Ministers of State. The Prime Minister is designated by the Diet, and the remaining ministers are appointed and dismissed by the Prime Minister. The Cabinet is collectively responsible to the Diet and must resign if a motion of no confidence is adopted by the House of Representatives.
The modern Japanese Cabinet was established in December 1885. It replaced the Dajō-kan that had been reactivated after the Meiji restoration as a modernized variation of the Daijō-kan, the imperial administration since the Nara period. The prime minister and the cabinet were appointed by and responsible to the Emperor. The cabinet system was continued under the Constitution of the Empire of Japan of 1889-1947. During the U.S.-led allied postwar occupation, the cabinet was reformed by Constitution of Japan which came into effect in 1947; since, the prime minister is elected by the Diet and the cabinet is responsible to the Diet.
==Appointment==
Under the constitution, Cabinet Ministers are appointed after the selection of the Prime Minister. A majority of the Cabinet, including the Prime Minister, must be members of the Diet (but may be members of either house), and all members must be civilians. Under the 2001 Cabinet Law, the number of Cabinet Ministers (excluding the Prime Minister) must be fourteen or less, but this may be increased to seventeen if a special need arises. In the event that the Cabinet collectively resigns it continues to exercise its functions until the appointment of a new Prime Minister. While they are in office, legal action may not be taken against Cabinet Ministers without the consent of the Prime Minister. The Cabinet must resign "en masse" in the following circumstances:
*When a motion of no confidence is adopted, or a vote of confidence defeated, by the House of Representatives, unless there is a dissolution of the house within ten days.
*Upon the first convocation of the Diet after a general election to the House of Representatives (even if every minister will then be reappointed).
*When the position Prime Minister becomes vacant, or the Prime Minister declares his intention to resign.
==Powers==
The Cabinet exercises two kinds of power. Some of its powers, while in practice exercised in accordance with the binding instructions of the Cabinet, are nominally exercised by the Emperor with the "advice and approval" of the Cabinet. Its other class of powers are exercised by the Cabinet explicitly. Contrary to the practice in many constitutional monarchies, the Emperor of Japan is not even the "nominal" chief executive. Instead, the Constitution explicitly vests executive authority in the Cabinet.
In practice, much of the Cabinet's authority is exercised by the Prime Minister. Under the Constitution, he exercises "control and supervision" over the executive branch, and no law or Cabinet order can take effect without his countersignature. While Cabinet Ministers in most other parliamentary regimes theoretically have some freedom of action (within the limits of collective responsibility), the Japanese Cabinet is effectively an extension of the Prime Minister's authority.
