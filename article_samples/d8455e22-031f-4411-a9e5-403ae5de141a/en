Scott Elliott Fahlman (born March 21, 1948) is a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University. He is notable for early work on automated planning in a blocks world, on semantic networks, on neural networks (and, in particular, the cascade correlation algorithm), on the Dylan programming language, and on Common Lisp (in particular CMU Common Lisp). In period of the standardization, he was recognized as "the leader of the Common Lisp." Recently, Fahlman has been engaged in constructing a Knowledge Base, "Scone", based in part on his thesis work on the NETL Semantic Network.
Fahlman was born in Medina, Ohio, U.S.. He received his bachelor's degree and master's degree in 1973 from MIT, and his Ph.D. from MIT in 1977. His thesis advisors were Gerald Sussman and Patrick Winston. He is a fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence.

The message was recovered by Jeff Baird on September 10, 2002 and is quoted:
