Paramecium () is a genus of unicellular Ciliate protozoa, commonly studied as a representative of the Ciliate group. "Paramecia" are widespread in freshwater, brackish and marine environments, and are often very abundant in stagnant basins and ponds. Because some species are readily cultivated and easily induced to conjugate and divide, "Paramecium" has been widely used in classrooms and laboratories to study biological processes. Its usefulness as a model organism has caused one ciliate researcher to characterize it as the "white rat" of the phylum Ciliophora.
