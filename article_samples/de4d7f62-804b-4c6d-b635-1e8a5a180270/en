The Gregorian Reforms were a series of reforms initiated by Pope Gregory VII and the circle he formed in the papal curia, circa 1050–80, which dealt with the moral integrity and independence of the clergy. These reforms are considered to be named after Pope Gregory VII (1073–85), though he personally denied this and claimed his reforms, like his regnal name, honored Gregory the Great.
