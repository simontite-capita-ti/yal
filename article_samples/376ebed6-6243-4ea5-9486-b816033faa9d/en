Lesa Lesa () is a 2003 Tamil film directed by Priyadarshan and produced by Vikram Singh. The film features Shaam and Trisha in the lead roles and Madhavan in an extended guest appearance, while Vivek, Radharavi and Sreenivasan play supporting roles. Cinematography is handled by Tirru, while the film's score and soundtrack were composed by Harris Jayaraj. The story is partially adapted from the 1998 Malayalam film "Summer in Bethlehem", which was co-written by Ranjith and Venu Nagavally.
The story starts with Chandru (Vivek) cheating most people in and around Ooty of their money due to his childish ventures. Though he hails from a rich family, he is unable to maintain the wealth because of his bad luck and unconcerned life style. He has a friend Rakesh (Shaam) who is a farm lord and a rich young man. Chandru saved Rakesh's life when he spotted him on a roadside accident on the hill side which he uses as a leverage for favours from the kind-hearted Rakesh.
