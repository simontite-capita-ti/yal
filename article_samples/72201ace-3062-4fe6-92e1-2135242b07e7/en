Prince of Persia is a video game franchise created by Jordan Mechner, originally published by Brøderbund, then the Learning Company, and currently Ubisoft.

The first game in the series was designed by Mechner after the success of his previous game with Brøderbund, "Karateka". The title was successful enough to spawn two sequels: the series has been rebooted twice since its acquisition by Ubisoft, and has been successful enough to warrant a , penned in part by Mechner and released by Walt Disney Pictures in 2010.
